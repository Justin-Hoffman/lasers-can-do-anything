Laser drilling is a critical process in modern manufacturing, enabling the creation of small, precise holes in a variety of materials. 
Unlike traditional drilling methods, which can be slow and imprecise, laser drilling offers unparalleled precision and speed, making it an essential tool in industries like aerospace, automotive, and electronics.

At its core, laser drilling works by using a high-energy laser to create a small hole in a material. 
The laser is focused on the material, causing it to heat up and melt, and then vaporize, creating a hole that is often less than a millimeter in diameter. 
The process can be repeated multiple times to create complex patterns of holes, allowing for the creation of intricate components with exacting tolerances.

One of the key advantages of laser drilling is its ability to work with a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, ceramics, and composites. 
This makes it an essential tool in industries that require precise, high-quality components, like aerospace and automotive. 
In addition to its versatility, laser drilling offers other advantages over traditional drilling methods, including faster processing times, higher accuracy, and the ability to create holes in materials that are difficult or impossible to drill using other methods. 
As a result, laser drilling has become an essential tool in modern manufacturing, enabling the creation of everything from jet engine components to high-tech medical devices.

The video above demonstrates the impressive speed and precision of laser drilling, as the laser quickly and accurately creates holes in this metal. This laser is a pulsed high power laser that uses repeated pulses, hundreds per second, to vaporize and remove the metal. This process is used to make parts for many different fields ranging from kitchen supplies like filters and collanders to combustor cooling liners for jet engines.
